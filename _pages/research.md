# Research

Our overarching aim is to advance the development of sustainable concrete, the most widely used human-made material, and to promote its critical role in the Net-Zero transition. Below are some of the key research areas we are currently working on.
Jump to: [Recycled Materials](#recycled-materials-for-sustainable-concrete), [Concrete Thermal Storage](#concrete-thermal-energy-storage), [Energy Storage Integration](#integration-of-energy-storage-and-net-zero-buildings).

### Recycled Materials for Sustainable Concrete
The global demand for concrete in building and infrastructure is rapidly increasing due to significant population growth and urbanisation. Simultaneously, industrialisation and urbanisation are generating vast quantities of recycled materials and industrial by-products. Our research focuses on examining and demonstrating the feasibility of incorporating these recycled/by-product materials into concrete to promote both circularity and sustainability, while maintaining the performance and durability of concrete. 

Check our recent paper on [recycled glass concrete](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950061824036183).

### Concrete Thermal Energy Storage
The global transition to renewable energy is progressing rapidly, but the increasing reliance on renewable sources like solar and wind brings challenges due to their intermittency. To accelerate renewable energy deployment, effective energy storage solutions are essential. Our research explores the emerging field of concrete thermal energy storage (CTES). We focus on: i) developing tailored concrete mixes with enhanced thermal properties and stability, and ii) demonstrating the application of these materials in CTES systems through computational modelling and experimental testing.

### Integration of Energy Storage and Net-Zero Buildings
The building sector is a major contributor to global energy demand and carbon emissions. Integrating renewable energy generation and storage into buildings has been widely recognised and implemented as a solution to reduce emissions. We have developed a comprehensive framework for the economic, environmental, and safety assessment of renewable-integrated buildings.
